  <title>Hi! This is a test of Nick's first website</title>
<body>
  Here I explain that I've written this website code to see what I'm able to do. I'm going to make the text red and font Calibri from here on.
  <br>
   <font size=14
        face="Calibri"
        color="red"
         See--the font is now red!
         </font>
